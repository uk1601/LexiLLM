- **User Profile Management**: Creates and maintains comprehensive user profiles with confidence scoring
- **Personalized Responses**: Tailors content based on user's technical level and interests
- **Natural Onboarding**: Progressively collects user preferences without disrupting conversation flow
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Command-line and Streamlit web interfaces with real-time streaming responses
- **Persistent Memory**: Maintains user preferences across sessions for consistent experiences

## 2. Technical Architecture

LexiLLM uses a modular architecture with clearly separated components for improved maintainability and testability:

### 2.1 Core Components

1. **LexiLLM Class (`bot.py`)**: Central orchestrator that coordinates the modules and manages the conversation flow. It delegates specific functionality to the specialized modules rather than implementing them directly.

2. **Intent Manager (`intent_manager.py`)**: Responsible for intent classification using LangChain structured output. It determines user's intent, handles follow-up detection, and manages confidence thresholds.

3. **Info Collector (`info_collector.py`)**: Manages collection of user information, both explicitly through direct questions and implicitly through natural conversation analysis.

4. **Response Generator (`response_generator.py`)**: Creates personalized responses using LangChain templates, supporting both standard and streaming responses based on user profile attributes.

5. **Conversation Manager (`conversation_manager.py`)**: Maintains conversation state, history, and handles transitions between different conversation states.

6. **User Profile Management (`user_profile.py`)**: Handles creation, persistence, and updating of user profiles with confidence scoring.

### 2.2 Benefits of Modular Architecture

The refactored modular architecture provides several key benefits:

- **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a clear responsibility, making it easier to update or fix specific components without affecting others.

- **Enhanced Testability**: Modules can be tested independently, improving test coverage and reliability.

- **Better Code Organization**: The codebase is logically organized with clear separation of concerns.

- **Reduced Complexity**: The main `LexiLLM` class is simpler, focusing on orchestration rather than implementation details.

- **Easier Extension**: New features can be added to specific modules without changing the entire system.

## 3. User Profile System

### 3.1 Components

- **ProfileAttribute**: Represents a single piece of user information with confidence scores and metadata
- **UserProfile**: Comprehensive user profile with information collected throughout conversations
- **UserProfileManager**: Handles persistence, extraction, and collection of user information

### 3.2 Key Profile Attributes

- **Basic Information**: name, preferred_name
- **Technical Background**: technical_level, background, experience_with_llms
- **Project Details**: project_stage, project_goal, industry
- **Preferences**: comparison_criterion, interest_area, communication_style, depth_preference
- **Session Information**: interaction history, topic history, onboarding status

### 3.3 Information Collection

- **Explicit Collection**: Direct questions during onboarding and conversation
- **Implicit Extraction**: Pattern-based extraction from natural conversation
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each attribute has a confidence score (0.0-1.0) and source
- **Progressive Collection**: Core attributes collected during onboarding, advanced attributes later

## 4. Conversation Flow

The modular architecture enables a sophisticated conversation flow with clear separation of responsibilities:

```

### 4.1 Conversation Stages

1. **Welcome & Onboarding**: First-time users go through a natural onboarding process
2. **Intent Classification**: User messages are classified into specific intents
3. **Information Collection**: If needed, user information is collected for personalization
4. **Response Generation**: Personalized responses are generated based on intent and user profile
5. **Follow-up Detection**: System detects if messages are follow-ups to previous questions
6. **Opportunity Detection**: System looks for natural opportunities to collect more information
7. **End Detection**: System recognizes when the user wants to end the conversation

## 12. Example Conversations

### 12.1 LLM Fundamentals Example

```
User: How do transformer models work?
LexiLLM: Before I explain, could you tell me your level of technical expertise with LLMs? (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
User: Beginner
LexiLLM: Thanks for sharing that! I'll explain transformers in a beginner-friendly way.

Transformer models are like super-powerful text processing engines. Imagine you're reading a sentence - your brain naturally connects words that go together, even if they're far apart. Transformers do this through a mechanism called "attention."

The key breakthrough of transformers is this attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on different words depending on context. For example, in "The cat sat on the mat because it was comfortable," a transformer can understand that "it" refers to "the mat," not "the cat."

Transformers process text in parallel (not word-by-word like older models), making them much faster to train. They're built with two main parts: an encoder (which understands input) and a decoder (which generates output).

Would you like me to explain any specific part of transformers in more detail?
```

### 12.2 LLM Implementation Example

```
User: I want to build a chatbot for my e-commerce site
LexiLLM: I'd be happy to help with that! To provide the most relevant guidance for your e-commerce chatbot, could you tell me what stage you're at with this project? (Planning/Development/Optimization)
User: Planning, just getting started
LexiLLM: Thanks for letting me know you're in the planning stage for your e-commerce chatbot! Here's a structured approach to get you started:

1. Define Your Scope:
   • Customer service (returns, shipping questions)
   • Product recommendations
   • Order tracking
   • Inventory questions
   • General FAQs

2. Choose Your Implementation Approach:
   • API-based (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   • Open-source model (hosted yourself)
   • Hybrid approach with multiple models

3. Consider This Basic Architecture:
   • Frontend chat interface on your website
   • Backend LLM integration
   • Knowledge base with your product and policy information
   • Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate answers

4. Don't Forget Safety Guardrails:
   • Content filtering
   • Fallback to human support when needed
   • Clear disclaimers about AI assistance

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas or discuss specific LLM options for e-commerce chatbots?
